# Unity-Glass

## Unity ##

This is intended to be used alongside a dock of your choosening

I am not that good with Javascript, anything user interface, CSS, and the rest of the gang doesnt like much when i code so i limit coding time a lot as well. So unless someone who knows what they do steps in, it will stay a bit bastardy and limited, and im sorry for that !


<div align="center">
  <table>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/teamcons/unity-glass/blob/main/images/screenshot.png" /></td>
  </table>
</div>



### What i dream of and know i can
- Glassy effect fully work
- Small indicators
- Basic optional standalone dock
- Glassy right click menu
- Settings : Change launcher to traditional (old one from 14.04), modern (Ubuntu Unity now), Yaru (Basic symbolic circle of friends)


### I cant the following please contribute dear stranger
- Bring from Dash-to-dock "focus, app spread, (minimize)", Unity backlights, autohide (dumb or smart)
- Cleaner colored backlights with animations like it "fukken shine" like my alter would say
- Adaptive colour for the dash according to wallpaper. Its so cool i cant even
- 3D accordion effect, i guess it requires some CSS rotate and some animation magic and all. Id love it if someone offered the feature
- Cool swishy where you can grab the dash and pull icons up and down. It's useless but it feels so much more homely than Gnome-Shell
- The trash can at the bottom. I guess it is a matter of putting the icon where the app starter is by default ? IDK

Please contribute or fork or anything idk, a girl needs her Unity
