# Unity-Glass

## Unity ##

This is intended to be used alongside a dock of your choosening
I feel like the "everything flat" trend makes everything look a bit soulless somewhat.

I am not that good with Javascript, anything user interface, CSS, and the rest of the gang doesnt like much when i code so i limit coding time a lot as well. So unless someone who knows what they do steps in, it will stay very crude and limited, and im sorry for that !

If you want to have a rad Unity experience :
- Dash-To-Dock extension for a dock
- +Last tab, indicator customizations, there is unity-like backlights
- Unite extension
- Blur-My-Shell extension

<div align="center">
  <table>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/teamcons/unity-glass/blob/main/images/screenshot.png" /></td>
  </table>
</div>



### Probably attainable by me
- Glassy effect be more precise, animated, and less crude
- Small arrow indicators for focus and opened apps
- Glassy right click menu
- Settings : Change launcher to traditional (old one from 14.04), modern (Ubuntu Unity now), Yaru (Basic symbolic circle of friends)
- Also choose glass encasing to be elegant case or awkward squircle ?


### I cant the following please contribute dear stranger
- Closer to Unity7
- Cleaner colored backlights with animations like it "fukken shine" like my alter would say
- Adaptive colour for the dash according to wallpaper. Its so cool i cant even
- 3D accordion effect, i guess it requires some CSS rotate and some animation magic and all. Id love it if someone offered the feature
- Cool swishy where you can grab the dash and pull icons up and down. It's useless but it feels so much more homely than Gnome-Shell
- The trash can at the bottom. I guess it is a matter of putting the icon where the app starter is by default ? IDK

Please contribute or fork or anything idk, a girl needs her Unity
