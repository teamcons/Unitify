# Unitify

## Transform any theme into an unity variant ##

This is a grossly done fork of Dash-to-dock. It is built with more "Unity-like" defaults, some removing, some tweaking, some adding, to be a self kinda working extension which replicates Unity by default.

I am not that good with Javascript, anything user interface, CSS, and the rest of the gang doesnt like much when i code so i limit coding time a lot as well. So unless someone who knows what they do steps in, it will stay a bit bastardy and bloated, and im sorry for that !

The settings would be simplified a lot, because not only cant i maintain something like Dash-to-Dock with all its moving parts, it would be a rad excuse to follow in Unity's footsteps to be basic and one-and-done (provided people dont look under the hood)


### I am working on :
- Have this actually working by hacking the CSS
- Simpler settings will all the lack of customization that made people angry, like in olden times
- Change launcher to traditional (old one from 14.04), modern (Ubuntu Unity now), Yaru (Basic symbolic circle of friends)


### I cant the following :
- Cleaner colored backlights with animations like it "fukken shine" like my alter would say
- Adaptive colour for the dash according to wallpaper. Its so cool i cant even
- 3D accordion effect, i guess it requires some CSS rotate and some animation magic and all. Id love it if someone offered the feature
- Cool swishy where you can grab the dash and pull icons up and down. It's useless but it feels so much more homely than Gnome-Shell
- The trash can at the bottom. I guess it is a matter of putting the icon where the app starter is by default ? IDK

Please contribute or fork or anything idk, a girl needs her Unity
